# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple turtle crossing game built using Python's `turtle` module. The player controls a turtle trying to cross the road while avoiding moving cars. The objective is to reach the top of the screen, and the game becomes progressively harder as you level up.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: The main file that runs the game. It initializes the screen, player, cars, and scoreboard, and controls the game loop.
- **player.py**: Handles the player's movements and position.
- **car_manager.py**: Manages the creation and movement of cars and increases difficulty as the player levels up.
- **scoreboard.py**: Displays the player's current level and shows the game over screen.

## How to Play

1. Use the **Up** arrow key to move the turtle up the screen.
2. Avoid the cars!
3. Reach the top of the screen to level up and reset to the starting position.
4. The cars will move faster with each new level.

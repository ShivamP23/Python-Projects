Turtle Race
* This is a simple turtle race game using Python's turtle module. You can bet on which turtle will win the race, and then watch as they race to the finish line!

How it Works:
* There are 6 turtles, each a different color: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
* You get to choose a color and bet on which one will win.
* The turtles move randomly, and the first one to reach the finish line wins.
* The game tells you if your turtle won or lost after the race.
Enjoy the game!

Coffee Machine Project:
* This is a simple coffee machine program I built using Python and OOP principles. The program lets users choose a coffee, checks if there are enough resources, and handles payments.

Features:
* Menu options: latte, espresso, cappuccino
* Reports: Shows current resources and money collected
* Payment system: Simulates inserting coins and checks if enough money is provided
* Turn off the machine by typing off, or view a report by typing report

Files:
* main.py: Runs the program.
* coffee_maker.py: Manages resources and makes coffee.
* menu.py: Stores available drinks.
* money_machine.py: Handles the money transactions.

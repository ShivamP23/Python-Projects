# Pong Game

A simple recreation of the classic Pong game using Python and the `turtle` graphics library.

## How to Play

- Player 1 (left paddle) uses `W` to move up and `S` to move down.
- Player 2 (right paddle) uses the `Up Arrow` to move up and the `Down Arrow` to move down.
- The objective is to score 10 points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

## Features

- **Ball Movement**: The ball moves and bounces off walls and paddles.
- **Paddle Control**: Players can control paddles with keyboard inputs.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the score for both players.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when one player scores 10 points, and the winner is displayed.

# U.S. States Game

This is a fun guessing game where you name all 50 U.S. states! It uses `turtle` graphics and `pandas` to check your answers and mark states on a blank U.S. map.

## How It Works
- The game shows a blank U.S. map.
- You type state names in a popup box.
- Correct guesses are marked on the map.
- Type "Exit" anytime to finish the game early and save any states you missed in a file called `states_to_learn.csv`.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `turtle` (included with Python)
- `pandas` (install using `pip install pandas`)
